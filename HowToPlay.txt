This is my first Java Game in the introdution to programminng.
In this game you will battle head to head with the computer.

Rules of the Game.
-This game has only one simple rule.
	Be the first to get 10 wins and you win the game.

How to play.
	-The player starts the game in which they are prompted to enter their name.
	-This is so as the computer can be able to be referencing the the player
	 by their real name.
	-The player then selects one of the three(Rock, Paper or Scissors);
	-The computer chooses one of these too without any bias.
	-The two selections are compared and the one that has chosen the 
	 mightier one wins the round.

The game is played 10 rounds and whoever wins or loses can choose to restart the Game
